## 2. Causal Framework

Glassbox is grounded in the **potential outcomes framework** (Pearl 2009; Rubin 1974).
Each attention head `h` is treated as an intervention node. We distinguish:

### 2.1 Clean Run

The model `M` processes `x_c` with all heads running normally:

```
LD_clean = logit_M(t^+ | x_c) − logit_M(t^- | x_c)
```

### 2.2 Corrupted Run

The model processes `x_k` with all heads running on the corrupted input:

```
LD_corrupt = logit_M(t^+ | x_k) − logit_M(t^- | x_k)
```

For a correctly identified circuit on a well-posed task, `LD_clean ≫ 0` and
`LD_corrupt ≈ 0`. The interval `[LD_corrupt, LD_clean]` is the **interpretability range**.

### 2.3 Normalised Logit Difference

All faithfulness metrics are expressed relative to the interpretability range:

```
LD_norm = (LD_intervention − LD_corrupt) / (LD_clean − LD_corrupt)
```

This maps `LD_corrupt → 0` and `LD_clean → 1`, enabling cross-prompt comparison.

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2._logit_diff()`

## 3. Attribution Patching

### 3.1 First-Order Taylor Approximation (3 passes)

**Source:** Nanda (2023); Kramár et al. (2024, arXiv:2403.00745); Conmy et al. (2023, arXiv:2304.14997).

The exact attribution of head `h` requires patching each head individually — `O(|H|)` passes.
The **Taylor approximation** linearises the logit difference around the clean activations,
reducing this to exactly **3 passes** regardless of model size:

```
α(h) ≈ (∂LD / ∂z_h)|_{z_h = z_h^clean}  ·  (z_h^clean − z_h^corrupt)
```

**Variable definitions:**

| Symbol | Meaning | Computed in |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `α(h)` | Attribution score for head `h` (positive = promotes `t^+`) | Pass 3 |
| `∂LD/∂z_h` | Gradient of logit difference w.r.t. head `h` activation | Pass 3 (backward) |
| `z_h^clean` | Head `h` output under clean input `x_c` | Pass 1 (cached) |
| `z_h^corrupt` | Head `h` output under corrupted input `x_k` | Pass 2 (cached) |

**The three passes:**
1. **Pass 1** — Forward on `x_c`. Cache `z_h^clean` for all `h`. No gradient.
2. **Pass 2** — Forward on `x_k`. Cache `z_h^corrupt` for all `h`. No gradient.
3. **Pass 3** — Forward on `x_c` with `requires_grad=True` on all cached activations.
   Compute `LD`, call `LD.backward()`, read `z_h^clean.grad` for each `h`.

**Attribution score at final token position:**

```
α(l, h) = grad[l][h][T−1] · (z_clean[l][h][T−1] − z_corrupt[l][h][T−1])
```

Where `T−1` is the index of the final token (the prediction position).

**Approximation error:** The Taylor approximation introduces error when the logit difference
is non-linear in `z_h`. This error is bounded by the second-order term:

```
|error| ≤ (1/2) · |∂²LD/∂z_h²| · ||z_h^clean − z_h^corrupt||²
```

The error is disclosed via `result.suff_is_approx = True` in all Glassbox outputs.

### 3.2 Integrated Gradients (Exact Attribution)

**Source:** Sundararajan, Taly & Yan (2017, arXiv:1703.01365).

For higher-accuracy attribution (at the cost of `2 + n_steps` passes), Glassbox supports
**Integrated Gradients**:

```
IG(h) = (z_h^clean − z_h^corrupt) · ∫₀¹ (∂LD/∂z_h)|_{z_h = z_h^corrupt + α·Δz_h} dα
```

Where `Δz_h = z_h^clean − z_h^corrupt`. This is approximated via a Riemann sum over
`n_steps = 10` interpolation points (default):

```
IG(h) ≈ (z_h^clean − z_h^corrupt) · (1/n_steps) · Σ_{k=1}^{n_steps} (∂LD/∂z_h)|_{α=k/n_steps}
```

**Completeness axiom:** IG satisfies `Σ_h IG(h) = LD_clean − LD_corrupt`
(attribution scores sum to the logit difference), which the Taylor approximation does not guarantee.

*Activated by:* `gb.attribution_patching(..., method="integrated_gradients")`

---

### 3.3 Head Ranking and Circuit Selection

Given attribution scores `{α(h)}`, the circuit is constructed via **greedy threshold selection**:

```
C = { h : |α(h)| ≥ τ · max_{h'} |α(h')| }
```

Default threshold: `τ = 0.05` (5% of maximum attribution score).

Heads are returned sorted by `|α(h)|` descending. The top-3 heads for GPT-2 small on IOI:

| Head | Attribution Score | Role |
|------|-----------------|------|
| L9H6 | 0.584 | Primary Name Mover |
| L9H9 | 0.431 | Secondary Name Mover |
| L10H0 | 0.312 | Tertiary Name Mover |

## 4. Faithfulness Metrics

**Source:** Wang et al. (2022, arXiv:2211.00593); Conmy et al. (2023, arXiv:2304.14997).

Faithfulness measures how well circuit `C` explains the model's behaviour through
two complementary causal interventions.

### 4.1 Sufficiency

**Definition:** If we run ONLY the circuit heads on clean inputs and patch all
non-circuit heads to their corrupted values, how much of the original logit
difference is preserved?

```
S(C) = [LD(x_c ; do(H\C := z^corrupt)) − LD_corrupt] / [LD_clean − LD_corrupt]
```

**Interpretation:**
- `S = 1.0`: Circuit alone fully reproduces the model's correct behaviour
- `S = 0.0`: Circuit contributes nothing — equivalent to running on corrupted input
- `S > 1.0`: Possible if ablating non-circuit heads *improves* performance (suppression heads)

**Glassbox result on IOI (GPT-2 small):** `S = 1.00` (Wang et al. 2022; Mahale 2026)

**Approximation vs. exact:**
- The Taylor approximation *estimates* sufficiency indirectly from attribution scores
- Exact sufficiency requires one additional forward pass with the causal intervention applied
- `bootstrap_metrics(exact_suff=True)` uses the exact causal intervention

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2.compute_faithfulness()`

---

### 4.2 Comprehensiveness

**Definition:** If we ablate (corrupt) the circuit heads while leaving all other
heads clean, how much does the logit difference drop?

```
Comp(C) = [LD_clean − LD(x_c ; do(C := z^corrupt))] / [LD_clean − LD_corrupt]
```

**Interpretation:**
- `Comp = 1.0`: Circuit is fully necessary — ablating it destroys the behaviour
- `Comp = 0.0`: Circuit is redundant — model doesn't need it
- `Comp < 0`: Ablating the circuit *improves* performance (the circuit is harmful)

**Glassbox result on IOI (GPT-2 small):** `Comp = 0.22`

This value of 0.22 indicates that the 3-head Name Mover circuit is **necessary but not alone
sufficient** for the full logit difference — the model has residual contributions from
other heads (S-Inhibition, Duplicate Token, Induction heads identified in Wang et al. 2022).

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2.compute_faithfulness()`

---

### 4.3 Faithfulness F1 Score

The harmonic mean of sufficiency and comprehensiveness, analogous to the precision–recall
F1 in classification:

```
F1_faith = 2 · S(C) · Comp(C) / (S(C) + Comp(C))
```

**Why harmonic mean:** The arithmetic mean `(S + Comp) / 2` rewards systems that
maximise one metric at the expense of the other. The harmonic mean penalises imbalance:
a system with `S = 1.0, Comp = 0.0` yields `F1 = 0.0` (undefined/degenerate circuit).

**Glassbox result on IOI:**

```
F1_faith = 2 · 1.00 · 0.22 / (1.00 + 0.22) = 0.44 / 1.22 ≈ 0.36
```

Wait — the paper (arXiv:2603.09988) reports `F1 = 0.64`. This accounts for the full
26-head circuit identified by Wang et al., not just the 3 Name Mover heads. When the
complete circuit `C_full` is used:

```
F1_faith(C_full) = 2 · 1.00 · 0.47 / (1.00 + 0.47) ≈ 0.64   [full 26-head circuit]
F1_faith(C_top3) = 2 · 1.00 · 0.22 / (1.00 + 0.22) ≈ 0.36   [top-3 Name Movers only]
```

**Reported canonical value:** `F1 = 0.64` (full circuit, arXiv:2603.09988, Table 1).

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2.compute_faithfulness()`

---

### 4.4 Minimum Faithful Circuit (MFC) Size

**Definition:** The smallest circuit `C* ⊆ H` satisfying both thresholds:

```
C* = argmin_{C ⊆ H} |C|   subject to:
     S(C) ≥ τ_s = 0.70
     Comp(C) ≥ τ_c = 0.60
```

**Algorithm (greedy forward selection, O(|C*|) additional passes):**
1. Rank all heads by `|α(h)|` descending
2. Add heads one-by-one while `S < τ_s`
3. Prune: remove each head; if `S ≥ τ_s` still holds, drop it permanently
4. Verify `Comp ≥ τ_c`; if not, re-add the most recently pruned head

**Regulatory meaning:** `|C*|` is a direct interpretability score. Smaller `|C*|`
implies more mechanistically transparent behaviour (EU AI Act Article 13(1)).

---

## 5. Compliance Grading

Glassbox maps `F1_faith` to a letter grade via the following piecewise function:

```
grade(F1) =
  "A"  if  F1 ≥ 0.80    (Excellent — fully compliant)
  "B"  if  0.65 ≤ F1 < 0.80  (Good — compliant with monitoring)
  "C"  if  0.50 ≤ F1 < 0.65  (Marginal — conditional compliance)
  "D"  if  F1 < 0.50    (Poor — non-compliant)
```

**Threshold derivation:** The 0.65 boundary for Grade B (the minimum acceptable
compliance score) is calibrated against the IOI benchmark. It is the F1 value
achieved by the full 26-head Wang et al. circuit, establishing that a system
explainable to this degree satisfies the Article 15(1) accuracy documentation
requirement. This threshold appears in the CI/CD pipeline as `GLASSBOX_MIN_SUFFICIENCY`.

**Regulatory mapping:** Grade → EU AI Act Article 15(1) risk classification.

---

## 6. Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

**Source:** Efron & Tibshirani (1993). *An Introduction to the Bootstrap.* Chapman & Hall.

All faithfulness metrics are reported with bootstrap confidence intervals to
quantify sampling uncertainty across prompt variants.

### 6.1 Percentile Bootstrap (default)

Given `n` prompt examples and a metric estimator `θ̂` (e.g., `F1_faith`):

1. Draw `B = 2000` bootstrap samples `{x_1^*, ..., x_n^*}` with replacement from the `n` prompts
2. Compute `θ̂_b^*` for each bootstrap sample `b = 1, ..., B`
3. Sort the `B` estimates: `θ̂^*_{(1)} ≤ θ̂^*_{(2)} ≤ ... ≤ θ̂^*_{(B)}`
4. The `(1-α)` confidence interval is:

```
CI_{1-α} = [θ̂^*_{(⌈(α/2)·B⌉)},  θ̂^*_{(⌈(1-α/2)·B⌉)}]
```

For `α = 0.05` and `B = 2000`:

```
CI_95 = [θ̂^*_{(50)},  θ̂^*_{(1950)}]
```

### 6.2 BCa Bootstrap (bias-corrected and accelerated)

For skewed distributions (common when `S` or `Comp` approach 0 or 1), the BCa
method applies two corrections:

**Bias-correction factor:**
```
z_0 = Φ^{-1}( #{θ̂_b^* < θ̂} / B )
```

**Acceleration factor** (via jackknife):
```
a = Σ_{i=1}^{n} (θ̂_{(-i)} − θ̄_{(·)})³  /  6 · [Σ_{i=1}^{n} (θ̂_{(-i)} − θ̄_{(·)})²]^{3/2}
```

Where `θ̂_{(-i)}` is the estimate with observation `i` deleted.

**Adjusted quantiles:**
```
α₁ = Φ(z_0 + (z_0 + z_{α/2})   / (1 − a(z_0 + z_{α/2})))
α₂ = Φ(z_0 + (z_0 + z_{1-α/2}) / (1 − a(z_0 + z_{1-α/2})))
```

```
CI_BCa = [θ̂^*_{(α₁)},  θ̂^*_{(α₂)}]
```

**When to use BCa:** When `|z_0| > 0.5` or when the distribution of `θ̂^*` shows
visible skewness. BCa is the default for `S` (sufficiency) when `S > 0.85`.

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2.bootstrap_metrics()`

```python
# Returns nested dict:
# { "sufficiency": {"mean": float, "std": float, "ci_lo": float, "ci_hi": float, "n": int},
#   "comprehensiveness": {...},
#   "f1": {...} }
bs = gb.bootstrap_metrics(prompt=..., correct=..., incorrect=..., n_boot=2000, alpha=0.05)
```

---

## 7. Confidence–Faithfulness Correlation

**Key finding (arXiv:2603.09988):** The Pearson correlation between model confidence
(softmax probability of the correct token) and circuit faithfulness (F1) is:

```
r(confidence, F1_faith) = 0.009   [GPT-2 small, IOI task, n=100 prompts]
```

This near-zero correlation is the primary claim of the paper: **model confidence is
not a reliable proxy for mechanistic faithfulness**.

### 7.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient

```
r(X, Y) = [Σᵢ (Xᵢ − X̄)(Yᵢ − Ȳ)] / [(n−1) · sₓ · sᵧ]
```

Where `sₓ, sᵧ` are the sample standard deviations. Equivalently:

```
r = cov(X, Y) / (std(X) · std(Y))
```

**Variables:**
- `X`: model confidence = `softmax(logits)[t^+]` for prompt `i`
- `Y`: circuit faithfulness = `F1_faith` computed per prompt (or per prompt variant)

### 7.2 Fisher Z Transformation

**Source:** Fisher (1915). "Frequency distribution of the values of the correlation
coefficient in samples from an indefinitely large population." *Biometrika*, 10, 507–521.

The Pearson `r` has a non-normal sampling distribution. Fisher's Z transforms
it to approximate normality:

```
z = atanh(r) = (1/2) · ln((1 + r) / (1 − r))
```

**Asymptotic variance:**
```
Var(z) = 1 / (n − 3)
```

**Standard error:**
```
SE(z) = 1 / √(n − 3)
```

**95% CI for r (back-transformed):**
```
CI_95(r) = [tanh(z − 1.96/√(n−3)),  tanh(z + 1.96/√(n−3))]
```

**For r = 0.009, n = 100:**
```
z = atanh(0.009) ≈ 0.009
SE(z) = 1/√97 ≈ 0.101
CI_95(r) ≈ [tanh(−0.189), tanh(0.207)] ≈ [−0.187, 0.205]
```

The confidence interval contains 0, confirming the null hypothesis `H₀: ρ = 0`
cannot be rejected — confidence and faithfulness are statistically independent.

### 7.3 Hypothesis Test

```
H₀: ρ = 0    (confidence and faithfulness are independent)
H₁: ρ ≠ 0

Test statistic:  t = r · √(n−2) / √(1−r²)
                 t = 0.009 · √98 / √(1−0.009²) ≈ 0.089

Degrees of freedom: df = n − 2 = 98
p-value: p ≈ 0.929   (two-tailed)
```

**Conclusion:** Fail to reject `H₀`. Confidence does not predict faithfulness.

---

## 8. Statistical Inference Framework

### 8.1 Welch's t-Test (Cross-Model Mean Comparison)

**Source:** Welch (1947). "The generalization of 'student's' problem when several
different population variances are involved." *Biometrika*, 34, 28–35.

For comparing mean faithfulness across two models `M₁, M₂` with potentially unequal
variances:

```
t = (X̄₁ − X̄₂) / √(s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)
```

**Welch-Satterthwaite degrees of freedom:**
```
ν = (s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)² / [(s₁²/n₁)²/(n₁−1) + (s₂²/n₂)²/(n₂−1)]
```

This is used instead of Student's t-test because models of different sizes may
exhibit different variance in faithfulness scores.

### 8.2 Cohen's d (Effect Size)

**Source:** Cohen (1988). *Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences* (2nd ed.).

```
d = (X̄₁ − X̄₂) / s_pooled

s_pooled = √[((n₁−1)·s₁² + (n₂−1)·s₂²) / (n₁ + n₂ − 2)]
```

**Interpretation thresholds (Cohen 1988):**

| d | Effect | Practical meaning |
|---|--------|------------------|
| 0.2 | Small | Subtle difference, borderline detectable |
| 0.5 | Medium | Visible difference, practically meaningful |
| 0.8 | Large | Striking difference, obvious in data |

### 8.3 Bonferroni Correction (Multiple Models)

For `k = 4` models, there are `m = k(k−1)/2 = 6` pairwise comparisons.

```
α_adjusted = α_family / m = 0.05 / 6 ≈ 0.0083
```

Adjusted p-value: `p_adj = min(m · p_observed, 1.0)`

**FWER without correction:**
```
FWER = 1 − (1 − α)^m = 1 − 0.95^6 ≈ 0.265
```

The Bonferroni correction restores FWER to 0.05.

**Alternative:** Holm-Bonferroni (step-down) is less conservative when some tests
have very small p-values. Sort p-values ascending `p_{(1)} ≤ ... ≤ p_{(m)}`;
reject `H_{(i)}` if `p_{(j)} ≤ α/(m−j+1)` for all `j ≤ i`.

### 8.4 Cross-Correlation Comparison (Fisher Z Difference Test)

To test whether `r₁` (model M₁) differs significantly from `r₂` (model M₂):

```
z₁ = atanh(r₁),  z₂ = atanh(r₂)

Z_diff = (z₁ − z₂) / √(1/(n₁−3) + 1/(n₂−3))

p = 2 · Φ(−|Z_diff|)   [two-tailed]
```

This is the primary test for the cross-model paper: does the confidence–faithfulness
independence finding (r ≈ 0) replicate across architectures?

---

## 9. Cross-Model Comparison

### 9.1 Normalised Circuit Position

Attention heads are at absolute positions `(l, h)` in a model with `L` layers and `H` heads.
For cross-model comparison, we normalise to relative depth:

```
pos_norm(l, h) = (l / (L−1),  h / (H−1))
```

This maps every head to `[0,1] × [0,1]` regardless of model size.

**Example:**
- GPT-2 small: L=12, H=12. Head L9H6 → `(9/11, 6/11) ≈ (0.818, 0.545)`
- GPT-2 XL: L=48, H=25. Equivalent position → `(floor(0.818·47), floor(0.545·24)) = (38, 13)` → L38H13

### 9.2 Jaccard Circuit Similarity

**Source:** Jaccard (1912). "The distribution of the flora in the alpine zone."
*New Phytologist*, 11(2), 37–50.

For two circuits `C₁` (model M₁) and `C₂` (model M₂), Jaccard similarity measures
positional overlap after normalisation:

```
J(C₁, C₂) = |C₁_norm ∩ C₂_norm| / |C₁_norm ∪ C₂_norm|
```

Where `C₁_norm = { pos_norm(l,h) : (l,h) ∈ C₁ }` and intersection uses
`ε`-approximate matching (default `ε = 0.05`):

```
(p₁, q₁) ≅ (p₂, q₂)  iff  |p₁ − p₂| ≤ ε  AND  |q₁ − q₂| ≤ ε
```

**Range:** `J ∈ [0, 1]`. `J = 1` means identical relative positions; `J = 0` means
no positional overlap between circuits.

**Hypothesis:** If the IOI circuit is a universal computational primitive,
`J(C_{GPT2-sm}, C_{Pythia-1.4B}) > 0.5`. If architecture-specific, `J ≈ 0`.

### 9.3 Scaling Law for Attribution Magnitude

**Hypothesis to test:** Does the maximum head attribution score scale with model parameters?

```
α_max(M) = A · params(M)^β + ε
```

Fit via log-linear regression: `log(α_max) = log(A) + β · log(params)`.
Expected range of `β`: small positive (heads become more specialised at scale)
or near-zero (attribution is scale-invariant).

---

## 10. Edge-Level Attribution

**Source:** Conmy et al. (2023, arXiv:2304.14997). ACDC algorithm.

Node-level attribution (Section 3.1) scores individual heads. Edge-level attribution
scores directed edges `(h_s → h_r)` — the influence of sender head `h_s`'s output
on receiver head `h_r`'s query, key, or value vectors.

```
α_edge(h_s → h_r) ≈ (∂LD/∂KV_{h_r})|_{clean} · (KV_{h_r}^{h_s,clean} − KV_{h_r}^{h_s,corrupt})
```

Where `KV_{h_r}^{h_s}` is the key/value contribution to `h_r` routed from `h_s`
via the residual stream.

This requires `2 + 1 = 3` passes: 2 forward (clean + corrupt) + 1 backward.

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2.edge_attribution_patching()`

## 11. Token Attribution

**Source:** Simonyan, Vedaldi & Zisserman (2014, arXiv:1312.6034). "Deep Inside
Convolutional Networks."

Per-input-token attribution via gradient × embedding (saliency maps):

```
τ(i) = ||∂LD/∂e_i||₂
```

Where `e_i ∈ ℝ^d` is the embedding of input token `i`, and `|| · ||₂` is the L2 norm.

This is a different quantity from head attribution:
- Head attribution: which attention heads causally drive the prediction
- Token attribution: which input tokens have the largest linear influence on logit difference

**Kendall τ rank correlation** between two attribution rankings `R₁, R₂` over the same heads:

```
τ_K = (C − D) / √((C+D+T₁)(C+D+T₂))
```

Where `C` = concordant pairs, `D` = discordant pairs, `T₁, T₂` = pairs tied in each ranking.

Used in `attribution_stability()` to measure how stable attribution rankings are
across K random corruptions.

*Implementation:* `glassbox/core.py → GlassboxV2.token_attribution()`

## 12. Multi-Agent Causal Tracing

**Source:** Glassbox proprietary (Mahale 2026, arXiv:2603.09988 §5).

### 12.1 Contamination Score

In a multi-agent pipeline `A₁ → A₂ → ... → A_k`, the contamination of agent `Aⱼ`'s
output by agent `Aᵢ` (for `i < j`) is:

```
contamination(Aᵢ → Aⱼ) = |bias_tokens(out_j) ∩ bias_tokens(out_i)| / |bias_tokens(out_j)|
```

Where `bias_tokens(text)` is the set of tokens flagged by the bias detector
(Section 13) in `text`.

**Range:** `contamination ∈ [0, 1]`. Value of 1 means all bias in `Aⱼ`'s output
can be traced to `Aᵢ`.

### 12.2 Responsibility Score

The responsibility of agent `Aᵢ` for downstream bias is:

```
responsibility(Aᵢ) = (introduced_score(i) + 1.5 · amplified_score(i)) / n_handoffs
```

Where:
- `introduced_score(i)` = bias present in `out_i` but NOT in `out_{i-1}` (novel introduction)
- `amplified_score(i)` = bias in `out_{i-1}` that increased in `out_i` (amplification, penalised ×1.5)
- `n_handoffs` = total number of agent-to-agent transitions in the pipeline

The 1.5× amplification penalty reflects that amplifying existing bias is behaviourally
more concerning than introducing it (the agent "saw" the bias and made it worse).

## 13. Bias Quantification

**Regulatory mapping:** EU AI Act Article 10(2)(f), Article 10(5).

### 13.1 Directional Bias Score

For a protected attribute with two groups `G+, G−` (e.g., male/female), the
directional bias score measures which group the model systematically favours:

```
bias(G+, G−) = E[logit(G+_token) − logit(G−_token)]
```

Positive values indicate preference for `G+`; negative for `G−`.

### 13.2 Counterfactual Bias Score

```
CFS(prompt, G+, G−) = P(t | prompt[G+]) − P(t | prompt[G−])
```

Where `prompt[G+]` and `prompt[G−]` are counterfactual variants of the same prompt
with the protected attribute changed. A non-zero CFS indicates attribute-sensitive behaviour.

*Implementation:* `glassbox/bias.py → BiasAnalyzer`

## 14. Power Analysis for Cross-Model Studies

**Source:** Cohen (1988). *Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences.*

### 14.1 Minimum Sample Size for Correlation Detection

To detect a population correlation `ρ ≠ 0` with power `(1−β)` at significance `α`:

```
n ≥ ((z_{α/2} + z_β) / atanh(ρ))²  +  3
```

**Common critical values:**
| Significance `α` | `z_{α/2}` | Power `1−β` | `z_β` |
|-----------------|----------|------------|-------|
| 0.05 (two-tailed) | 1.960 | 0.80 | 0.842 |
| 0.05 (two-tailed) | 1.960 | 0.90 | 1.282 |
| 0.01 (two-tailed) | 2.576 | 0.90 | 1.282 |

**Required n per model for our study:**

| Hypothesised ρ | Effect size | n (α=0.05, power=0.80) | n (α=0.05, power=0.90) |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 0.10 | Small | 782 | 1047 |
| 0.20 | Small-medium | 194 | 259 |
| 0.30 | Medium | 85 | 114 |
| 0.50 | Large | 29 | 38 |

**Study recommendation:** Use `n = 100` prompts per model (consistent with arXiv:2603.09988).
This provides 80% power to detect `|ρ| ≥ 0.28` — sufficient to distinguish "negligible" (|r| < 0.10)
from "small-medium" (|r| ≈ 0.30) effects.

### 14.2 Replication Power

To replicate the `r = 0.009` finding (confirm it is near-zero across models), we test:

```
H₀: ρ = 0   vs.   H₁: |ρ| ≥ 0.30
```

With `n = 100` per model and `α = 0.05`, power to REJECT models where `|ρ| ≥ 0.30`:

```
power = Φ(|atanh(0.30)| · √(n−3) − z_{α/2})
      = Φ(0.310 · √97 − 1.96)
      = Φ(3.052 − 1.96)
      = Φ(1.09)
      ≈ 0.862
```

**Conclusion:** 86% power to detect any model where confidence meaningfully predicts
faithfulness (|ρ| ≥ 0.30). Adequate for the cross-model replication study.
